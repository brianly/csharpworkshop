#Getting Started with C# on Linux
This file is part of a multi-series workshop on learning C# on Linux available [here](../README.md).

Author: [Martin Woodward](https://github.com/MartinWoodward)

First of all we want to get .NET Core installed on your environment.
For instructions see http://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/ and follow the instructions for
the platform of your choice.

## Getting started on RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) or CentOS

At the time of writing, the RPM packages for .NET Core are not publicly available. Therefore to install
with ```yum``` please do the following:

 - Install the dependencies:
``` 
 sudo yum install â€“y libicu libuuid libcurl openssl libunwind
```
 - Download the latest dev build:
```
 wget https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/dev/Binaries/Latest/dotnet-centos-x64.latest.tar.gz
```
 - Unpack the build somewhere (e.g. $HOME/bin/dotnet)
```
 mkdir -p ~/bin/dotnet
 tar xf dotnet-centos-x64.latest.tar.gz -C ~/bin/dotnet
``` 
 - Add `~/bin/dotnet/bin` to your `PATH` and set `DOTNET_HOME` to `~/bin/dotnet`. One way
    to do this is by adding the following to your `.bashrc` file.
```
 export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/dotnet/bin
 export DOTNET_HOME=$HOME/bin/dotnet
```

## Getting started on Ubuntu & Debian based distributions

See http://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/ for the latest instructions, but essentially:

 - Add the dotnet apt-get feed
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/dotnet/ trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver apt-mo.trafficmanager.net --recv-keys 417A0893
sudo apt-get update
```
 - Install .NET Core
```
sudo apt-get install dotnet-nightly
```

## Conclusion
That's it - you should have dotnet installed on your system. You should be able to 
type `dotnet --version` to verify. Next, lets create a new application 
and learn about the structure of a C# program.
