#Getting Started with C# on Linux
This file is part of a multi-series workshop on learning C# on Linux available [here](../README.md).

First of all we want to get .NET Core installed on your environment.
For instructions see http://dot.net/core and follow the instructions for
the platform of your choice.

## Getting started on Fedora 25

At the time of writing, the RPM packages for .NET Core are not publicly available on Fedora 25 (they exist
for Fedora 23 & 24). Therefore we must install from source - see the 
[instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/core/pull/326#issuecomment-262479168) to learn more.

If you would like to install the very latest (Daily Build) of .NET core then take a look at the [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/blob/master/README.md) repo.

Alternativelu
```
sudo dnf copr enable nmilosev/dotnet-clean
sudo dnf install dotnetcore -y
```

## Conclusion
That's it - before moving on from this point you should have dotnet installed on your system. You should be able to 
type `dotnet --version` to verify. Next, lets create a new application 
and learn about the structure of a C# program.
