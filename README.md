# Workshop: Learning C# on Linux

This repository contains the content for a workshop I am putting together
on Learning C# on Linux using .NET Core.  This is a work in progress 
so feel free to contribute but I'll probably make some major
changes here before porting the content over to somewhere official like
The [.NET Core Docs](https://github.com/dotnet/core-docs).

## Learning C# on Linux
C# is a modern, advanced general purpose programming language and is now fully open source and supported on Linux. In this 90 minute workshop you will learn how to be productive with the new modern C# on Linux, what it is like building high performance web workloads in ASP.NET and what tooling support you have available including how to configure your favorite editor and more.

**Target Audience:** This workshop is aimed at developers with no prior knowledge of C#
but have experience with other programming languages.

## Workshop Contents

 1. Getting Started - Installing pre-requisites and getting .NET Core installed on your system
 1. Hello C# World - Learn the structure of a basic C# program
