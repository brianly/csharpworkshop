# Workshop: Learning C# on Linux

This repository contains the content for a workshop I am putting together
on Learning C# on Linux using .NET Core.  This is a work in progress 
so feel free to contribute. Also take a look at the official like
the [C# Interactive Tutorial](https://www.microsoft.com/net/tutorials/csharp/getting-started).

A copy of the introductory slide deck accompanying this tutorial is available [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AnoZDWDiiqDHxd84US2gj0Kp_DAT4A).

## Learning C# on Linux
C# is a modern, advanced general purpose programming language and is now fully open source and supported on Linux.
In this short workshop you will learn how to be productive with the new modern C# on Linux,
what it is like building high performance web workloads in ASP.NET and what tooling support you have available.

**Target Audience:** This workshop is aimed at developers with no prior knowledge of C#
but have some experience with other programming languages or would like a refresher on the modern C# language.
